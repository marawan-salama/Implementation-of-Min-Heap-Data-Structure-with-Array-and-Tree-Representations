# Implementation-of-Min-Heap-Data-Structure-with-Array-and-Tree-Representations

• Implemented a min-heap structure using two different data structures: an array and a tree.
• Implemented the ArrayCompleteTree representation, which represents the tree as an array of elements, allowing for efficient
access to parents and children.
• Implemented the TreeCompleteTree representation, which represents the tree as a tree of nodes with pointers to the parent and
left/right children, enabling easier navigation.
• Developed algorithms for locating specific nodes in the complete tree.
• Built a min-heap using the complete tree structure, following the "re-heapification upward" and "re-heapification downward"
algorithms described in the textbook.
• Implemented an invariant checker for both representations of the complete tree.
• Passed all tests for ArrayCompleteTree and TreeCompleteTree implementations.
• Completed the MinHeap class, including the removeMin method, and passed all corresponding tests.
• Conducted exhaustive and random tests to validate the correctness and efficiency of the implemented data structures and
algorithms.
